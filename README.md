Dataset Description
The primary dataset consists of NYC Yellow and Green Taxi trip records from 2019 to 2021. This data provides comprehensive trip information, including:

Trip details: Pickup and dropoff times, trip distances, fare amounts, passenger counts.
Geographic information: PULocationID (Pickup Location ID) and DOLocationID (Dropoff Location ID).
Fare structure variables: RatecodeID, payment type, congestion surcharge, and more.
Key Characteristics of Taxis:
Yellow Taxis: Operate mainly in Manhattan.
Green Taxis: Serve outer boroughs such as Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, with limited operations in Manhattan.
Why This Dataset?
The inclusion of fare structure variables enables us to explore pricing dynamics and assess the impact of taxi regulations, such as congestion surcharges and rate codes, on fare amounts.
