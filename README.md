## Dataset Description
The project uses NYC Yellow and Green Taxi trip datasets, which include the following key features:
- **Trip Information**: Pickup and dropoff times, trip distances, passenger counts, and fare amounts.
- **Geographic Information**: Pickup and Dropoff Location IDs (PULocationID and DOLocationID).
- **Fare Structure Variables**: RatecodeID, payment type, and congestion surcharge, allowing for an in-depth investigation into pricing and taxi regulations.

### Taxi Service Areas
- **Yellow Taxis**: Predominantly operate in Manhattan.
- **Green Taxis**: Serve the outer boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx), with limited operation in Manhattan.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Trip Behaviors**:
   - Identify temporal patterns in taxi usage (e.g., rush hours, seasonal trends).
   - Examine spatial distribution of pickups and dropoffs.
2. **Explore Fare Dynamics**:
   - Assess fare variations based on trip distance, time, and location.
   - Investigate the impact of taxi regulations, such as congestion surcharges.
3. **Understand Geographic Trends**:
   - Evaluate how Yellow and Green taxis serve different boroughs and regions.
